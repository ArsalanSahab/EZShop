# EZShop
EZShop is a brick-and-mortar modular shopping infrastructure that provides customers with a completely frictionless shopping experience. Inspired by the recent innovations revealed by Amazon Go, our team ambitiously wanted to recreate the same experience - on a student budget. Furthermore, we wanted to innovate and go one step further - users of Amazon Go have to scan in and out of the store with a barcode to verify their identity. We wanted to remove that friction as well, and we did. With just everyday mobile devices, and a Raspberry Pi, we created EZShop.

The proof-of-concept that we actually created is incredibly true to our vision - we have built a revolving-door shopping system where individuals register into our database by providing only their name and a picture of themselves. Customers can then enter our shop by simply walking by the camera stationed at our entrance, and can pick up an item and have it automatically added to their cart. Items are detected as picked up by placing light sensors and ultrasound under their respective racks.

Managers can also track customers in their stores in realtime through our manager app by seeing which customers are in store and what they have in their cart.

Customers can view their cart in real time on their phone with our companion app and then walk out past our exit camera and be notified of their bill on their phone. All without human interaction, barcode scanning, and best of all, without wait times.
